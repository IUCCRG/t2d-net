IU Integrative Data Science Lab (IDSL) Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus project

The output dataset produced by the IU Integrative Data Science Lab T2DM project.  In this CTSI-funded project, "Semantically mapping the hidden molecular connections of type-2 diabetes", Chem2Bio2RDF and SLAP were applied for knowledge discovery.  We share the resulting dataset as a knowledge network (KN), for further use by the research community.
